1. Make it possible to add images directly from the selected element menu. Currently it is only possible to add an image if no images exist. It should be possible if an image is selcted as wel by selectning an "add new image" option.
2. Add a save dialog. The dialog should ask:
    1. Whether the WB is intended to be used in illustrator. This will make it left align text as the positioning is not preserved. Users will have to manually center align afterwards
    2. Whether images should be embedded in the SVG or linked
3. Automatically prompt the user to import missing images when opening a save file
